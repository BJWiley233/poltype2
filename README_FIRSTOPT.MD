## First Geometry Optimization Readme
* Defaults are MP2/6-31G*
* Try 5 cycles, if ater 5 cycles any bond deviates more than .2 angstroms from the original structure, then increase the cycles and reoptimize until bond lenths converge tighter
* If MP2 crashes with gaussian, then try with psi4
* If MP2 with psi4 crashes, then try wB97X-D
